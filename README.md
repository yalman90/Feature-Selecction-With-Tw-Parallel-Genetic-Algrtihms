we seek a new solution for the feature selection problem. This new approach is based on the use of two parallel genetic algorithms having respectively high and low mutation rates. Evolving fast and slow requires a new parallel architecture combining an automatic system that evolves quickly and a laborious system that evolves slowly. With this architecture, exploration and exploitation can occur simultaneously and in unison. Evolving fast, with a high mutation rate, can be useful for exploring new, unfamiliar places in the search space with long hops; and Evolving Slow, with a low mutation rate, can be useful for exploiting previously known spots in the search space with short moves. Our experiments show that fast and slow evolution achieve very good results in terms of accuracy and feature elimination.
